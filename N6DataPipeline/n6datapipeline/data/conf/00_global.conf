# The RabbitMQ server location:
host = rabbit   ; hostname or IP address
port = 5671     ; port number

# If you want to secure the connections to the RabbitMQ server with
# SSL (TLS), which is *highly recommended* (at least on production
# systems!), you need to:
# * set the `ssl` option to true; and
# * set the `ssl_ca_certs` option to the CA certificate(s) file path
#   (to be used to verify the RabbitMQ server's certificate).
ssl = true
ssl_ca_certs = ~/certs/n6-CA/cacert.pem

# It is possible to use SSL (TLS) *also* for client-certificate-based
# authentication. To ensure that, you need to:
# * set `ssl` and `ssl_ca_certs` as appropriate (see above...); and
# * specify the client certificate file path and that certificate's
#   private key file path, by setting the following `ssl_certfile`
#   and `ssl_keyfile` options to appropriate paths; and
# * ensure that `password_auth` (see below...) is commented out or
#   explicitly set to false.
ssl_certfile = ~/certs/cert.pem
ssl_keyfile = ~/certs/key.pem

# If you prefer username-and-password-based authentication (rather
# than client-certificate-based), you need to:
# * set `password_auth` to true; and
# * set `username` and `password` to appropriate credentials.
# (Note: if `password_auth` is true and `username` is set to a non-empty
# value other than guest, `password` needs to be set to a secret password
# being at least 16 characters long.)
