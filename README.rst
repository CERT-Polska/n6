*n6* (Network Security Incident eXchange) is a system to collect, 
manage and distribute security information on a large scale (see:
https://www.cert.pl/en/projekty/).  Distribution is realized through a
simple REST API and a web interface that authorized users can use to
receive various types of data, in particular information on threats
and incidents in their networks.
