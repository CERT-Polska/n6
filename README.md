[*n6* (Network Security Incident eXchange)](https://www.cert.pl/en/posts/2018/06/n6-released-as-open-source/)
is a system to collect, manage and distribute security information on a
large scale. Distribution is realized through a simple REST API and a
[web interface](https://n6portal.cert.pl/) that authorized users can use
to receive various types of data, in particular information on threats
and incidents in their networks.
