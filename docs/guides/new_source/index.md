The aim of this book is to introduce the developer to the pipeline
of implementing new data source for the *n6*.

## Overview

This guide consists of 2 main chapters.

* The ***Collectors*** chapter about Collectors which are
the main entry points for the external data to the *n6*.
With these we will be able, for example, to download data from the
web and send it for further processing.
* The ***Parsers*** chapter introducing the next pipeline stage
of the external data processing. Parsers come right after
collectors. Their goal is to transform the data to the 
form digestible by *n6*.
