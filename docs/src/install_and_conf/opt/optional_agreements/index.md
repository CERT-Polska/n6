# Organization Agreements

## Opening remarks

**Optional agreements** is a set of configurable entries in *n6 Admin Panel* which allows users of *n6 Portal* (being a part of a particular *n6* instance) to agree to additional terms provided by the instance's admin. The set of those terms is empty by default, but can be easily populated in *n6 Admin Panel* via the *Agreements* tab. This guide provides all the necessary information to set up these agreements.
