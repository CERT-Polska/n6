# Configuring *n6* Components

!!! warning

    This guide suggests to base your *n6* configuration on the *configuration
    prototype files* shipped with the *n6* source code (namely: those you
    can find in `n6/etc/...`). Then, for the purposes of this guide, only
    several settings in a few files need to be adjusted (see below...),
    and the rest can be left intact.

    Please keep in mind, however, that many elements acceptable for the
    purposes of this guide would **not** be acceptable in the case of a
    production system -- in particular:

    * any **insecure passwords/secrets** (like those set to the silly
      `password` text, and generally all passwords/secrets you can find in
      the configuration prototype files **shipped with the *n6* source code**;
      but also any invented or generated by you if they were too weak...)
    * any uses of the **example SSL (TLS) certificates/keys** (*aka* X.509
      certificates/keys) **shipped with the *n6* source code** (more
      generally: beware of using any potentially insecure/compromised
      certificates and keys; possible oversights may also include too
      wide file access permissions when it comes to an SSL (TLS) private
      key file)
    * any network communication **not secured with SSL (TLS)** at all
    * any cases of **unnecessarily wide permissions** (e.g., the use of
      the ``` `root`@`localhost` ``` MariaDB acoount)


## Where Are We?

Again, before any operations, ensure the current working directory is
the home directory of `dataman` (which is supposed to be the user in
whose shell you execute all commands):

```bash
cd ~
```

Also, make sure the Python *virtual environment* [in
which](installation.md#new-virtual-environment) *n6* has been
[installed](installation.md#actual-installation) is active:

```bash
source ./env_py3k/bin/activate
```


## Configuring *n6 Pipeline*

Configuration files for the *n6 Pipeline* components are to be placed in
the `.n6` subdirectory of the `dataman` user's home directory.

### Copying Configuration Prototypes

First, copy the configuration prototype files shipped with the *n6*
source code:

```bash
cp n6/etc/n6/*.conf .n6/
```

Now, the output from the command:

```bash
ls -l /home/dataman/.n6/
```

...should be similar to the following:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  1868 Jun 20 13:41 00_global.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  1152 Jun 20 13:41 00_pipeline.conf
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   625 Jun 20 13:41 05_enrich.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   710 Jun 20 13:41 07_aggregator.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   396 Jun 20 13:41 07_comparator.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  1887 Jun 20 13:41 09_auth_db.conf
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  1106 Jun 20 13:41 21_recorder.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   204 Jun 20 13:41 23_filter.conf
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  1311 Jun 20 13:41 60_abuse_ch.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  3539 Jun 20 13:41 60_amqp.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   328 Jun 20 13:41 60_cert_pl.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   462 Jun 20 13:41 60_cesnet_cz.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman   313 Jun 20 13:41 60_dan_tv.conf
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman 15320 Jun 20 13:41 admin_panel.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 dataman dataman  4033 Jun 20 13:41 logging.conf
```

!!! info

    All those configuration files are in the popular
    [*INI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)-like format.

    Generally, each *n6 pipeline* component tries to load -- from the
    `/etc/n6/` and `~/.n6/` directories (in this order; although, concerning
    this guide, only the latter is present) -- all configuration files whose
    names match the pattern `<two decimal digits>_<whatever>.conf`. In the
    case of each of those two directories (if it exists), the files are
    loaded in the order resulting from sorting the filenames alphabetically.

    Note that configuration sections and options *may* be repeated. In such
    cases, the option value encountered later "wins" (so the loading order
    matters).

    Each component picks only the configuration section(s) relevant to it --
    ignoring all others.

!!! note

    What is important for each component are *names* of configuration
    *sections* and *options* -- *not* names of configuration files (apart
    from the required `<two decimal digits>_<whatever>.conf` format and
    the loading order discussed in the *Info* box above).

    Nevertheless, the names of the configuration files from `n6/etc/` do
    suggest which components their contents apply to. In particular, these
    files are relevant to these *n6 pipeline* components:

    * `00_global.conf` and `00_pipeline.conf` -- to most components
    * `05_enrich.conf` -- to the `n6enrich` component
    * `07_aggregator.conf` -- to the `n6aggregator` component
    * `07_comparator.conf` -- to the `n6comparator` component
    * `09_auth_db.conf` -- to any components connecting to *Auth DB*
    * `21_recorder.conf` -- to the `n6recorder` component
    * `23_filter.conf` -- to the `n6filter` component
    * any `60_*.conf` files -- to respective *collectors* and *parsers*, i.e.,
      particular `n6collector_*` and `n6parser_*` components supposed to deal
      with respective external *data sources*

    !!! note ""
    
        **See also:**

        *[Architecture and Data Flow Overview](../../data_flow_overview.md)*

    ***

    There are also two special configuration files:

    * `logging.conf` -- loaded by a separate (logging-dedicated) machinery,
      relevant to all *n6 pipeline* components (and also to the *Admin Panel*
      web component, discussed later in this chapter...)
    * `admin_panel.conf` -- ignored by *n6 pipeline* components (as it is
      relevant only to the *Admin Panel* web component)

### Adjusting Configuration Files

For the purposes of this guide, just a few *n6-pipeline*-related
configuration options in a few files need to be adjusted...

#### RabbitMQ Connectivity

Edit the `~/.n6/00_global.conf` configuration file to ensure that the
`host`, `password_auth`, `username` and `password` options in the
`[rabbitmq]` section are set as follows:

```ini
[rabbitmq]

host = localhost
# ...
password_auth = true
username = guest
password = guest
```

(Make sure that these options are *not* commented out with a leading `;`
character)

Keep the remaining options in that file intact.

#### *Event DB* Connectivity (`n6recorder`)

Edit the `~/.n6/21_recorder.conf` configuration file to ensure that the
`uri` option in the `[recorder]` section is set as follows:
  
```ini
[recorder]

uri = mysql://root:password@localhost/n6
```

(And keep the remaining options in that file intact.) 

#### *Auth DB* Connectivity

Edit the `~/.n6/09_auth_db.conf` configuration file to ensure that the
`url` option in the `[auth_db]` section is set as follows:
  
```ini
[auth_db]

url = mysql://root:password@localhost/auth_db
```

!!! note

    For historical reasons, the relevant option name is **`url`** in the
    case of *Auth DB* (here), even though it is **`uri`** in the case of
    *Event DB* (see above).

Also, in the same `[auth_db]` section, adjust the three SSL-related
options by setting them to `none`:

```ini
[auth_db]
# ...
ssl_cacert = none
ssl_cert = none
ssl_key = none
```

(And keep the remaining options in that file intact.) 

#### Logging Settings

Edit the special configuration file `~/.n6/logging.conf` to adjust the
general *n6 pipeline*'s configuration of logging, by modifying the
content of the `[logger_root]` section -- to make it look like this:

```ini
[logger_root]
level = INFO
handlers = file
```

The rest of the settings in `~/.n6/logging.conf` should be OK for the
purposes of this guide. Of course, you can customize some of them if you
like (the
[possibilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format)
are wide...).

#### Optionally: Other Settings...

You may also want to adjust some other configuration options, relevant
to various *n6 pipeline* components -- customizable by editing various
`~/.n6/*.conf` configuration files... See the *Note* box near the end of
the *[Copying Configuration Prototypes](#copying-configuration-prototypes)*
section earlier in this chapter.

Also, see the helpful comments you can find in many of those
configuration files.


## Initializing *n6's Databases*

As mentioned earlier, *n6* uses the following two SQL databases:

* *Event DB* -- stores all network incidents information collected by the
  *n6* system, in the *n6-pipline-components*-processed form of
  *[event](../../usage/restapi.md#overview)* records (aka *normalized
  events*). Given that amounts of stored *events* may be huge and write
  throughput may be high, this database makes use of the *RocksDB* engine.

* *Auth DB* -- stores information needed to authenticate users of *n6
  Portal* and clients of the *n6*'s public APIs, and to authorize those
  users/clients to access different subsets of data stored in *Event DB*.
  Apart from that, some auxiliary information (not necessarily related to
  authentication and authorization) is also stored in *Auth DB*. This
  database makes use of the standard *InnoDB* engine.


### *Event DB*

Create and initialize *Event DB* (as a new MariaDB database called `n6`):

```bash
cat \
    n6/etc/mysql/initdb/1_create_tables.sql \
    n6/etc/mysql/initdb/2_create_indexes.sql \
  | sudo mysql -u root
```

!!! warning

    The command first drops the target database (if it already existed).

The above command may take several seconds to execute. It is not
expected to print any output.


### *Auth DB*

Create and initialize *Auth DB* (as a new MariaDB database called `auth_db`):

```bash
n6create_and_initialize_auth_db --drop-db-if-exists --yes
```

!!! warning

    The command first drops the target database (if it already existed).

Near the end of the command's output the following line should appear:

```
* The 'n6create_and_initialize_auth_db' script exits gracefully.
```

Now, populate *Auth DB* with some example data...

```bash
n6populate_auth_db \
  --access-to-inside \
  --access-to-threats \
  --access-to-search \
  --set-password \
  example.com \
  login@example.com
```

This command first asks you to enter (interactively!) a password for the
newly created user (see below...), and then adds the following data to
*Auth DB*:

* a bunch of declarations of *data sources* with appropriate general
  access *subsources* (i.e., definitions of data feeds to which client
  organizations can have access)
* a new client organization --
    * whose identifier (`org_id`) is `example.com`
    * which has access to:
        * the `inside` access zone (*[n6 REST API]*'s resource `report/inside`),
          with the aforementioned *subsources* enabled
        * the `threats` access zone (*[n6 REST API]*'s resource `report/threats`),
          with the aforementioned *subsources* enabled
        * the `search` access zone (*[n6 REST API]*'s resource `search/events`),
          with the aforementioned *subsources* enabled
* a new *n6* user --
    * whose identifier (`login`) is `login@example.com`
    * whose password is _**what you just entered interactively**_
      (remember it, as it will be needed [later...](check.md#first-time-on-n6-portal))
    * which belongs to the aforementioned `example.com` organization
      (with all its access rights)

!!! info

    The identifier of an organization (`org_id`) is supposed to be a DNS
    domain of that organization.

    The identifier of a user (`login` *aka* `user_id`) is supposed to be
    an e-mail address of that user.

Near the end of the above `n6populate_auth_db` command's output the
following line should appear:

```
* The 'n6populate_auth_db' script exits gracefully.
```

!!! tip

    You could execute the above command specifying also other command-line
    options...

    In particular, the `--full-access` option would set the `full_access`
    marker to `True` on the newly created organization. If an organization
    has `full_access=True`, all users belonging to it are *privileged* --
    i.e., authorized to see all event attributes without limitations and
    any anonymization, and also to access events with the `restriction`
    attribute set to `"internal"` (such events can never be accessed by
    non-privileged users).

    Try `n6populate_auth_db --help` to learn more about the available
    command-line options.

## Configuring *n6's Web Components*

!!! note

    In this tutorial, for the sake of simplicity, some of the *n6* web
    components' configuration prototype files (shipped with the *n6* source
    code) are (ab)used as *actual configuration files* (i.e., you will edit
    them in-place, without copying).

### *n6 Portal*

#### Building the *n6 Portal*'s Frontend (GUI)

```bash
cd ~/n6/N6Portal/react_app
```

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix
```

```bash
yarn build
```

```bash
cd ~
```

#### Configuring *Event DB* and *Auth DB* Connectivity

Edit the `n6/etc/web/conf/portal.ini` configuration file to modify the
`sqlalchemy.url` and `auth_db.url` options, so that they have the
following values:

```ini
# ...
# event db configuration
# ...
sqlalchemy.url = mysql://root:password@localhost/n6

# ...
# auth db configuration
# ...
auth_db.url = mysql://root:password@localhost/auth_db
```

#### Disabling (or Configuring) *Mail Notices*

!!! info

    E-mail messages are sent to users of *n6* when something related to them
    or their organization happens, e.g., a *password reset* is requested, an
    *organization configuration update request* is submitted by any of the
    organization's users, etc.

    This feature is called *mail notices*. In production, it is definitely
    necessary (without it the service would be hardly usable), but for the
    purposes of this guide you can disable it.

To disable the *mail notices* feature in *n6 Portal*, edit the
`n6/etc/web/conf/portal.ini` configuration file to modify the
`mail_notices_api.active` option, so that it is set to `false`:

```ini
# ...
# mail notices configuration + jinja rendering configuration
# ...
mail_notices_api.active = false
```

!!! tip

    On the other hand, you may want to keep this feature enabled -- to test
    it using a fake SMTP (e-mail) server. If you decide to do so, then just:

    * edit the same `n6/etc/web/conf/portal.ini` configuration file to modify
      the `mail_sending_api.smtp_host` option by setting it to `localhost` and
      ensure that the `mail_sending_api.smtp_port` option is set to `1025` (of
      course, keeping the aforementioned `mail_notices_api.active` option set
      to `true`);

    * install the [*MailDump* fake SMTP
      server](https://pypi.org/project/maildump/) by executing the command:
      `pip install maildump`, and then run it in the background by executing
      the command: `maildump -p maildump.pidfile` (it will start listening
      for SMTP connections on port 1025; see also: `maildump --help`).

    From now on, you can use a web browser to visit
    [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) to interactively explore
    any e-mail *notices* sent by *n6 Portal*.


#### Logging Settings

Edit the content of the sections placed near the end of the same
`n6/etc/web/conf/portal.ini` configuration file: `[loggers]`,
`[handlers]`, `[formatters]` and further ones -- to customize the *n6
Portal* backend's configuration of logging (the
[possibilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format)
are wide...).

In particular, it is worth modifying the content of the `[logger_root]`
section to make it look like this:

```ini
[logger_root]
level = INFO
handlers = file, console
```

The rest of the *n6 Portal* backend's logging settings should be OK for
the purposes of this guide.

#### Optionally: Other Settings...

You may also want to customize some other configuration options in
various parts of the same `n6/etc/web/conf/portal.ini` file. See the
numerous helpful comments you can find in that file...

#### Prepare, Enable, Start!

Copy these two *Apache* site files shipped with the *n6* source code:

```bash
sudo cp \
    ~dataman/n6/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf \
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/
```

```bash
sudo cp -a \
    ~dataman/n6/etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-portal.conf \
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/
```

Then edit the new `/etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-portal.conf` file to
replace the existing `WSGIDaemonProcess` directive, consisting of
several lines, with its new version, consisting of the following three
lines:

```
    WSGIDaemonProcess n6-portal \
        python-path=/home/dataman/env_py3k/lib/python3.11/site-packages \
        python-eggs=/home/dataman/.cache/n6/n6portal/python3k-eggs
```

Do not forget to set the appropriate file access permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf \
  && sudo chown root:root /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-portal.conf \
  && sudo chown root:root /etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-portal.conf
```

Also, create the directory for the `python-eggs` cache:

```bash
cd ~ \
  && mkdir -m 710 .cache/n6/n6portal \
  && chown dataman:www-data .cache/n6/n6portal \
  && mkdir -m 770 .cache/n6/n6portal/python3k-eggs \
  && chown dataman:www-data .cache/n6/n6portal/python3k-eggs
```

Now, enable the newly configured Apache site:

```bash
sudo a2ensite n6-portal
```

The command's output should include:

```
Enabling site n6-portal.
```

Finally, start serving your own *n6 Portal*!

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

*n6 Portal* should now be available. Try to visit it using a web browser
at [https://localhost/](https://localhost/). You should see the *n6
Portal*'s log-in page.

!!! note

    Because of the use of the *insecure example certificate* shipped with
    the *n6* source code, any modern web browser is expected to warn you
    that the connection is not secure. **Before the browser agrees to
    display the site, you may need to confirm that you accept the risk.**
    Also, for your convenience, you may want to add in your browser a
    permanent security exception for this site.

!!! note ""

### *n6 REST API*

#### Configuring *Event DB* and *Auth DB* Connectivity

Edit the `n6/etc/web/conf/restapi.ini` configuration file to modify the
`sqlalchemy.url` and `auth_db.url` options, so that they have the
following values:

```ini
# ...
# event db configuration
# ...
sqlalchemy.url = mysql://root:password@localhost/n6

# ...
# auth db configuration
# ...
auth_db.url = mysql://root:password@localhost/auth_db
```

#### Logging Settings

Edit the content of the sections placed near the end of the same
`n6/etc/web/conf/restapi.ini` configuration file: `[loggers]`,
`[handlers]`, `[formatters]` and further ones -- to customize the *n6
REST API*'s configuration of logging (the
[possibilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format)
are wide...).

In particular, it is worth modifying the content of the `[logger_root]`
section to make it look like this:

```ini
[logger_root]
level = INFO
handlers = file, console
```

The rest of the *n6 REST API*'s logging settings should be OK for the
purposes of this guide.

#### Optionally: Other Settings...

You may also want to customize some other configuration options in
various parts of the same `n6/etc/web/conf/restapi.ini` file. See the
numerous helpful comments you can find in that file...

#### Prepare, Enable, Start!

Copy the relevant *Apache* site file shipped with the *n6* source code:

```bash
sudo cp -a \
    ~dataman/n6/etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-restapi.conf \
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/
```

Then edit the new `/etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-restapi.conf` file to
replace the existing `WSGIDaemonProcess` directive, consisting of
several lines, with its new version, consisting of the following three
lines:

```
   WSGIDaemonProcess n6-restapi \
       python-path=/home/dataman/env_py3k/lib/python3.11/site-packages \
       python-eggs=/home/dataman/.cache/n6/n6restapi/python3k-eggs
```

Do not forget to set the appropriate file access permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-restapi.conf \
  && sudo chown root:root /etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-restapi.conf
```

Also, create the directory for the `python-eggs` cache:

```bash
cd ~ \
  && mkdir -m 710 .cache/n6/n6restapi \
  && chown dataman:www-data .cache/n6/n6restapi \
  && mkdir -m 770 .cache/n6/n6restapi/python3k-eggs \
  && chown dataman:www-data .cache/n6/n6restapi/python3k-eggs
```

Now, enable the newly configured Apache site:

```bash
sudo a2ensite n6-restapi
```

The command's output should include:

```
Enabling site n6-restapi.
```

Finally, start serving your own *n6 REST API*!

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

*n6 REST API* should now be available.
Try to visit one of its endpoints using a web browser:
[https://localhost:4443/report/inside.json](https://localhost:4443/report/inside.json).
You should see an *401 Unauthorized* error page (HTTP status 401);
that's OK for now!

!!! note

    Because of the use of the *insecure example certificate* shipped with
    the *n6* source code, any modern web browser is expected to warn you
    that the connection is not secure. **Before the browser agrees to
    display anything, you may need to confirm that you accept the risk.**


### *n6 Admin Panel*

#### *Auth DB* Connectivity

Edit the `~/.n6/admin_panel.conf` configuration file (one of those you
created when preparing the *n6 pipeline* configuration) to ensure that
the `url` option in the `[auth_db]` section is set as follows:

```ini
[auth_db]

url = mysql://root:password@localhost/auth_db
```

Also, in the same `[auth_db]` section, adjust the three SSL-related
options by setting them to `none`:

```ini
[auth_db]
# ...
ssl_cacert = none
ssl_cert = none
ssl_key = none
```

#### RabbitMQ Connectivity

Edit the same `~/.n6/admin_panel.conf` configuration file to ensure that the
`host`, `password_auth`, `username` and `password` options in the
`[rabbitmq]` section are set as follows:

```ini
[rabbitmq]

host = localhost
# ...
password_auth = true
username = guest
password = guest
```

(Make sure that these options are *not* commented out with a leading `;`
character)

#### Disabling (or Configuring) *Mail Notices*

!!! info

    E-mail messages are sent to users of *n6* when something related to them
    or their organization happens, e.g., an *organization configuration
    update request* is accepted or rejected by an administrator, etc.

    This feature is called *mail notices*. In production, it is definitely
    necessary, but for the purposes of this guide you can disable it.

To disable the *mail notices* feature in *n6 Admin Panel*, edit the
`~/.n6/admin_panel.conf` configuration file to modify the `active` option
in the `[mail_notices_api]` section, so that it is set to `false`:

```ini
[mail_notices_api]
# ...
active = false
```

!!! tip

    On the other hand, you may want to keep this feature enabled -- to test
    it using a fake SMTP (e-mail) server. If you decide to do so, then just:

    * edit the same `~/.n6/admin_panel.conf` configuration file,
      specifically its section `[mail_sending_api]`, to modify the `smtp_host`
      option in by setting it to `localhost` and ensure that the `smtp_port`
      option is set to `1025` (of course, keeping the aforementioned `active`
      option in the `[mail_notices_api]` section set to `true`);

    * if you haven't already done so when configuring *n6 Portal*, install the
      [*MailDump* fake SMTP server](https://pypi.org/project/maildump/) by
      executing the command: `pip install maildump`, and then run it in the
      background by executing the command: `maildump -p maildump.pidfile` (it
      will start listening for SMTP connections on port 1025; see also:
      `maildump --help`).

    From now on, you can use a web browser to visit
    [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) to interactively explore
    any e-mail *notices* sent by *n6 Admin Panel*.


#### Logging Settings

Unlike other *web* components, *n6 Admin Panel* shares its logging
settings with the *n6 pipeline* components -- see the [relevant
section](#logging-settings) earlier in this chapter...

#### Optionally: Other Settings...

You may also want to customize some other configuration options in
various parts of the `~/.n6/admin_panel.conf` file. See the helpful
comments you can find in it...

#### Prepare, Enable, Start!

Copy the relevant *Apache* site file shipped with the *n6* source code:

```bash
sudo cp -a \
    ~dataman/n6/etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-adminpanel.conf \
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/
```

Then edit the new `/etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-adminpanel.conf` file
to replace the existing `WSGIDaemonProcess` directive, consisting of
several lines, with its new version, consisting of the following six
lines:

```
    WSGIDaemonProcess n6-adminpanel \
        user=dataman \
        home=/home/dataman/ \
        threads=2 \
        python-path=/home/dataman/env_py3k/lib/python3.11/site-packages \
        python-eggs=/home/dataman/.cache/n6/n6adminpanel/python3k-eggs
```

Do not forget to set the appropriate file access permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-adminpanel.conf \
  && sudo chown root:root /etc/apache2/sites-available/n6-adminpanel.conf
```

Also, create the directory for the `python-eggs` cache:

```bash
cd ~ && mkdir -p .cache/n6/n6adminpanel/python3k-eggs
```

Now, enable the newly configured Apache site:

```bash
sudo a2ensite n6-adminpanel
```

The command's output should include:

```
Enabling site n6-adminpanel.
```

Finally, start serving the *Admin Panel* app:

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

*n6 Admin Panel* should now be available. Try to visit it using a web
browser at [https://localhost:4444/](https://localhost:4444/). You
should see the *n6 Admin Panel* home page.

!!! note

    Because of the use of the *insecure example certificate* shipped with
    the *n6* source code, any modern web browser is expected to warn you
    that the connection is not secure. **Before the browser agrees to
    display the site, you may need to confirm that you accept the risk.**
    Also, for your convenience, you may want to add in your browser a
    permanent security exception for this site.

!!! warning

    Unlike other *web* components of *n6*, the *n6 Admin Panel* application
    by itself does not have any authentication mechanism! (So, in
    particular, never make it public, unless you protect it with some
    external authentication layer...)
