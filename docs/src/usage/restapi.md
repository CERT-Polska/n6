# n6 REST API

The API described in this document is the *n6* system's main interface
to share security information with external systems and applications.
The interface takes the form of a simple REST-style service, based on
the HTTP(S) protocol.


## Overview

*n6* uses an *event*-based data model to represent all types of security
information. Each *event* can be represented by a JSON object with a set
of mandatory and optional attributes -- such as: `time`, `category`,
`address`, `fqdn`, `origin`... (see the [*Event Attributes*](#event-attributes)
section below)

*n6 REST API* makes it possible to retrieve any event data to which the
client's organization is authorized to access.


### Request

Only [*GET*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) requests are supported.

#### Authentication

The API's authentication mechanism is based on *API keys*. Your *API
key* needs to be sent in an HTTP `Authorization` header, using the
*Bearer* schema (the value of the header should look like the following:
`Bearer YOUR-API-KEY`). You can generate a new *API key* through *n6
Portal*.

#### URI

The *n6 REST API*'s URI scheme can be described with the following
[ABNF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2234) syntax rule:

```
uri = "https://" server "/" resource "." format "?" query
```

-- where:

- **_server_** is the API server's fully qualified domain name (*note*:
  it is `n6api.cert.pl` in the case of the CERT Polska's instance of *n6*).
- **_resource_** identifies the desired scope of data to be retrieved.
  Available *resources* are:
    - `report/inside` -- events related to the client's organization
      networks/services (only visible to this organization);
    - `report/threats` -- general threat indicators, typically shared
      with other organizations, i.e., not particularly related to the
      client's organization networks/services; can be useful, e.g., for
      blocking rules;
    - `search/events` -- global search (*note:* this one is not available
      in the case of the CERT Polska's instance of *n6*).
- **_format_** is the requested format, such as `json`, `sjson` or `csv`.
- **_query_** (described in the [next subsection](#query)) specifies
  which events are to be retrieved.

#### Query

Generally, the *query* part of a URI defines a list of conditions on
selected event attributes.

Its syntax can be described using the following
[ABNF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2234) rules:

```
query           = parameter *("&" parameter)
parameter       = name "=" value-or-values
value-or-values = value *(comma value)
comma           = "," / "%2C"
                ; bare or percent-encoded comma character
```

-- where:

* **_name_** identifies one of the valid query parameters -- see the
  [*Query Parameters*](#query-parameters) section below.
* **_value_** of a query parameter is a
  [UTF-8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629#section-3)
  string which may consist of any characters except `,` (comma),
  provided that all non-"safe" characters are
  [*percent-encoded*](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1).
  (To be more precise: the "safe" characters that never require such
  encoding are: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_` and `~`; also
  unencoded `:` is acceptable in this context. To keep us on the safe
  side, any other characters -- including also byte components of
  UTF-8-encoded non-ASCII characters -- should appear *only in their
  percent-encoded form*; and the `,` character *cannot be included at
  all*, even in its percent-encoded form!)

Multiple *values* of a query parameter can be specified by separating
them with `,` (bare or percent-encoded) or, alternatively, just by
repeating the parameter with different *values*.

!!! warning "Caution"

    The `time.min` parameter is mandatory for every query. A query without
    it will result in a redirection (a HTTP response with status code 307)
    to a URI containing the query with that parameter added.

#### Example URIs (with Queries)

```
https://n6api.cert.pl/report/inside.json?ip=198.51.100.234&modified.min=2024-02-12T00:00:00Z&time.min=2024-02-01T00:00:00Z
https://n6api.cert.pl/report/inside.json?name=%27%25xxx%27%3D&time.min=2024-02-01T01:01:01Z
https://n6api.cert.pl/report/inside.sjson?name=malware1,malware2&time.min=2024-02-01T01:02:03Z
https://n6api.cert.pl/report/inside.csv?name=malware1&name=malware2&time.min=2024-02-01T04:05:06Z
https://n6api.cert.pl/report/threats.json?time.min=2024-02-01T07:58:59Z
```


### Response

*n6 REST API* uses standard HTTP status codes: **200** (success),
**307** (redirection), **400** (incorrect *query*), **401** (auth
required), **403** (no permission), **404** (incorrect *resource*
or *format*), **500** (server error).

In case of an immediate error, a response containing a text description
of the error is returned, with a suitable HTTP status code. However, if
an error occurs when some part of the proper (non-error) response body
has already been emitted (using [chunked transfer
encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding#chunked_encoding)...),
the emission of the response is just discontinued.

The content of a proper response body depends on the requested *format*
(see the [previous section](#request)). For `json`, it is a single
*array* (in the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format) whose
elements are *objects*, each of which represents a single *event*. Those
objects' possible attributes (keys) are described in the [*Event
Attributes*](#event-attributes) section below.

If you expect large responses, we recommend using a "streamed" variant
of `json`: the `sjson` format -- where the response consists of
concatenated top-level objects delimited by newlines (line feed, i.e.,
ASCII 0x0A). Each top-level object is represented in a single line (no
pretty-print), which allows to parse results incrementally. Otherwise
this format is identical with plain `json`.

Retrieved events are always sorted by their `time`, descendingly.

#### Example Response Body

## Attributes and Parameters (Reference)

All *event attributes* and *query parameters* supported by the current
version of *n6* are listed in the following sections â€“ except that in
this document we do *not* cover any attributes/parameters that are
visible/available *only* for *privileged* users [*technically: those
users whose organizations have the `full_access` flag set to `True` in

- `email` (*string*) E-mail address associated with the threat (e.g.,
  source of spam, victim of a data leak).
- `expires` (*string*) Time until which the blacklist entry

      have changed, so now the entry is represented by another event (see
      above: `replaces`)
- `target` (*string*) Organization or brand that is the target of the
  attack (applicable to phishing).
- `time` (*string*) **[mandatory]** Time of event occurrence (i.e., in the

  3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)-compliant way.
- `url` (*string*) URL related to the event (*note:* formally, it is a
  *URI* or *IRI*, according to the respective definition in [RFC
  3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) or [RFC
  3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987)).

- `x509subject` (*string*) Subject of an SSL/X.509 certificate.


### Query Parameters

Many of the event attribute names listed in the [previous section](#event-attributes)
are also valid names of query parameters. Those parameters are:

- `category`
- `confidence`
- `dport`
- `fqdn`
- `id`
- `md5`
- `name`
- `origin`
- `proto`
- `replaces`
- `sha1`
- `sha256`
- `source`
- `sport`
- `status`
- `target`
- `url`

Each of those parameters, if specified, narrows search results to events
which have the corresponding attribute set to a value matching the
specified parameter value (or, if multiple values of the parameter are
specified, matching *any* of them).

Similarly, these are query parameters which correspond to component
fields of the `address` attribute:

- `ip`
- `cc`
- `asn`

Additionally, the following query parameters can be used to specify
wider search criteria:

- `ip.net` -- IPv4 network in CIDR notation, e.g. `203.0.113.0/24`
  (referring to `ip` values in events' `address`).
- `fqdn.sub` -- substring of events' `fqdn`.
- `url.sub` -- substring of events' `url`.

A special class of query parameters are those specifying *time ranges*.
The name of each of those parameters consists of two parts:

- the first part determines which time-related attribute(s) is/are to
  be tested (see below);
- the second part is one of:
    - `.min` -- meaning that the parameter specifies a minimum value (i.e.,
      that matching attribute values are *greater than or equal to* the
      parameter value).
    - `.max` -- meaning that the parameter specifies a maximum value (i.e.,
      that matching attribute values are *less than or equal to* the parameter
      value).
    - `.until` -- like `.max`, but *excluding* the parameter value from the
      time range being specified (which means that matching attribute values
      are *less than* the parameter value).

Those special parameters are:

- `time.min` **[mandatory]**, `time.max`, `time.until` -- referring to
  events' `time`.
- `modified.min`, `modified.max`, `modified.until` -- referring to
  events' `modified`.
- `active.min`, `active.max`, `active.until` -- referring to the
  `expires` attribute if an event has it (which applies to blacklist
  entries), and otherwise to the `time` attribute.

Each of those parameters, if present, should be set to a time in an [RFC
3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)-compliant format
(using only the upper-case form of the letters `T`/`Z`, if any of them
is present) -- except that the UTC offset part can be omitted (then just
`+00:00` is assumed).

A few examples:

- `time.min=2023-10-25T00:00:00Z` would select events with `time` set
  to midnight on October 25, 2023 (UTC), or to any later time;
- `time.min=2024-09-04T18:46:42&time.max=2024-09-04T19:59:01` would
  select events with `time` set to any times from 6:46 p.m. and 42
  seconds to 7:59 p.m. and 1 second, on September 4, 2024 (UTC) --
  *including* that upper limit (i.e., the specified interval is a
  *right-closed* one);
- `time.min=2024-09-04T18:46:42&time.until=2024-09-04T19:59:01` would
  select events with `time` set to any times from 6:46 p.m. and 42
  seconds to 7:59 p.m. and 1 second, on September 4, 2024 (UTC) --
  *excluding* that upper limit (i.e., the specified interval is a
  *right-open* one).

!!! note

    `time.min` is the only query parameter that is *mandatory*.

Apart from all that, global *query options* can be specified using the
following parameters:

- `opt.limit` (integer) -- maximum number of events to be retrieved
  (as noted earlier, events are always sorted by their `time`,
  descendingly). *Note:* by default, no limit is imposed.
- `opt.primary` (Boolean flag: `true` or `false`; default value:
  `false`) -- set it to `true` to restrict the content of retrieved
  events to *primary data* (the original data from data sources), i.e.,
  to hide event attributes (or their child objects' items) whose values
  were determined/inferred by the *n6* system itself (e.g., by performing
  DNS/GeoIP queries).

When it comes to the special *time range* and *query option* parameters
described above, each of them can have at most one value (i.e., *no
multiple values* of a parameter are allowed).
