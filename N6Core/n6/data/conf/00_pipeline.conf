# The n6 components use the 'pipeline' section to configure their
# "place" in the RabbitMQ pipeline. To configure a component, create
# the option, which name equals to the component's lowercase class
# name. Each option can be assigned a list of values (each value being
# a string, separated by commas). These values, called "routing states"
# here, are then used to generate their binding keys - keys that
# assign messages sent by other components within the same exchange
# to the component's inner queue.
#
# Routing states that components' output messages are sent with:
# * Parsers: parsed
# * Aggregator: aggregated
# * Enricher: enriched
# * Comparator: compared
# * Filter: filtered
# * Recorder: recorded
#
# Values in this configuration template create a default order
# of components in n6 pipeline.
